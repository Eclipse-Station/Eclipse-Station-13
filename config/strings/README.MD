## Tip of the Round system

The Tip of the Round system pulls one string from the tips.txt (95% chance) or the sillytips (5% chance). The relevant code for this is mostly self-contained in /modular_eclipse/code/modules/admin/verbs/totr.dm.

### When adding serious tips, please follow this format:

* For miscellaneous tips that can apply to everyone, please put "Did you know?" before it.
* For job-specific tips for *non-heads-of-staff*, please precede it with "As a(n) [job name]", e.g.: "As an Assistant, ..."
* For job-specific tips for *heads of staff*, please precede it with "As the [job name]" (note the "the"), e.g.: "As the Head of Security, ..."

This format exists so that if someone is unsure if a tip is serious or not, they can glance at it and tell. **THIS FORMAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED FOR MEME TIPS, IF THERE MAY BE ANY AMBIGUITY WHATSOEVER WHETHER IT'S SERIOUS OR NOT, OR IF THE TIP IS FALSE.**

### When adding meme tips, please consider the following:

* Does it look like a serious tip and follow the format of one? Is it false and will following it cause serious damage to the station or crew; e.g.: "As an Engineer, oxygen is a better coolant than phoron"? **Don't add it, period.**
* Does it look like a serious tip and follow the format of one? Is it false, but following it won't seriously harm anyone; e.g.: "Did you know? Throwing a doughnut at the officer trying to arrest you is more effective than running"? **Strip it of the serious tip formatting.**
* Is it obviously silly, but follows the format of a serious tip; e.g.: "As an Engineer, building teleporters will help your team reach the front lines faster"? **Consider stripping off the serious-tip formatting, if it doesn't detract from the joke.**
* Is it a serious tip, but doesn't really fit in with the serious tips; e.g.: "As a Pathfinder, the information you're probably looking for is on the Bay wiki"? **If it is factually accurate, feel free to add it.**
